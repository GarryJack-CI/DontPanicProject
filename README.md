## Accessibility

### Color Scheme

Using a [color palette generator](https://coolors.co/2f200f-826341-d5a572-3f645a-8eb8ac-a7c8bf-dbad6a-dfd5a0), I chose the following colors as they were neutral and contrasted well with each other (checked using a [color contrast checker](https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/))
- #2F200F
- #826341
- #D5A572
- #3F645A
- #8EB8AC
- #A7C8BF
- #DBAD6A
- #DFD5A0

### Fonts

I did research on fonts that were designed to reduce visual stress and improve accessibility for visually impaired users, and decided to use the following font families:
- Atkinson Hyperlegible **(Primary)**
- Arial **(If primary font fails to load)**

## Reflection on Development Process

### Final Thoughts

#### Challenges

I had a lot of difficulty setting up the dropdown menu in the navbar. Unfortunately, I put it aside in the end as I didn't want to run out of time to finish other aspects of the project.

I also struggled to make the project responsive using the bootstrap grid classes.

#### Reflections

I will take more care in the future during the design of my projects to keep my code tidy and ordered. I will also research areas which I showed weakness in during this project.

Overall, I am happy with the structure and content of the project for the mobile viewport. Given more time, I believe I would be able to address any gaps in the project and optimise the website for all viewports.
