### Color Scheme

Using a [color palette generator](https://coolors.co/2f200f-d5a572-8eb8ac-dbad6a-dfd5a0), I decided to use the following colors for the background:
- #D5A572
- #619B8A
- #DBAD6A
- #DFD5A0

For the foreground, I chose a color that would contrast well with the background and checked it using the [Color Contrast Checker](https://https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/):
- #2F200F

### Fonts

I did research on fonts that were designed to reduce visual stress and improve accessibility for visually impaired users, and decided to use the following font families:
- Atkinson Hyperlegible **(Primary)**
- Arial **(If primary font fails to load)**
